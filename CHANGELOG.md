# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Fixed live streaming in the Home Assistant add-on with the new per-source stream supervisor: the Icecast start script now drops Icecast to its own account when started as root so the supervisor can read the add-on's root-owned settings, and idles instead of restart-looping when a wrapper ships without the supervisor. Stream listeners are no longer force-reconnected on access changes; nginx re-checks them on their next connection.
- Fixed stations refusing to start after an update when a saved setting breaks a rule added since it was written, such as equal storage trigger and target percentages. Every rule now repairs such a value around what was set (the storage target moves below the trigger), and the Settings page names the problem when a hand-edited file cannot be read at all.
- Improved station load by sampling settings status and probing the model service only while the Settings page is open, instead of for every connected browser on every page.
- Fixed the Settings audio summary staying unavailable after another device saved settings, until the window regained focus.
- Fixed settings saves from API clients behind a compressing proxy failing the revision check.
- Fixed a source that failed to start before quiet hours being reported as an audio issue for the whole pause.
- Fixed Settings briefly claiming services had not reported the active model when reopened after being closed for a while.
- Fixed source toggles submitting the editor immediately; source changes now wait for Save and prompt before unsaved edits are discarded.
- Improved audio status responsiveness after startup and source changes by reporting transitions promptly and keeping slow model checks from delaying audio updates.
- Fixed unrelated disabled or paused source pills pulsing when another source is changed.
- Changed audio-source saves to use the existing status indicators instead of extra success messages.
- Improved Settings loading with a small status skeleton while live health first arrives, avoiding misleading unavailable messages while keeping the form usable.
- Improved Settings status updates by sharing live audio and model health over the existing connection, removing browser polling and clearing stale status after disconnection.
- Improved audio status in Settings with one recording and streaming summary, source pills that pulse while connecting, and per-source details inside the editor.
- Fixed compressed settings responses causing false save conflicts and unavailable audio status, and overlapping page loads incorrectly opening the setup wizard on configured stations.
- Fixed model changes replacing an explicitly selected filter threshold, and background refreshes allowing open source or species editors to overwrite newer settings from another session.
- Added live audio-source reload: changing a source reconnects its recorder and live stream while other sources continue. Settings now shows recording and streaming status separately, and keeps model changes marked as awaiting restart until services confirm the saved model is loaded.
- Fixed settings saves overwriting unrelated drafts or newer changes from another session, and invalid settings replacing the last valid runtime configuration. Queued audio now retains its captured duration and is resampled for the loaded model; disabling public access also disconnects existing live listeners.
- Fixed the Settings page briefly showing empty defaults — most visibly "recording is paused" — before the real values loaded: the form now opens from last-known settings without letting background refreshes overwrite edits, stays current after instant saves, and shows a loading skeleton on a genuine first load
- Changed every dropdown to one shared, green-accented control so they look and behave identically everywhere — replacing the scattered `<select>` styles (four corner radii, four heights, four focus treatments, two drawing no focus ring at all) and the divergent custom menus. The whole control, open menu included, is now drawn by the app rather than the operating system, so it matches across browsers; keyboard use works throughout (arrow keys, Enter, and type-ahead — where a native select's letter-jump used to be the only option); the Charts time-range and period pickers are no longer hidden on phones, where they couldn't be changed at all; and the Table and Charts species search boxes were unified into one field with a clear button and consistent name matching.
- Fixed logging out leaving the browser's live status connection authorised: the server now revokes that signed session, closes only its owner connections, and reconnects a public Live Feed only after the logout cookie is cleared, while anonymous logout requests and other signed-in devices leave owner connections alone
- Fixed audio sources saved before the enable/disable toggle existed being treated as disabled by Settings while the recorder still recorded them, so the page could claim recording was paused on a station that was recording
- Fixed the recorder status pill briefly showing an older state when overlapping status refreshes, a live update, or logout raced, which could persist until the next broadcast up to a minute later
- Fixed simultaneous settings saves from separate controls or browser tabs silently overwriting one another, including access, notification, and quiet-hours changes
- Fixed disabling every audio source being reported as a fault: with no active source the station now shows the blue "Audio Paused" pill and status badge (plus a hint under the source list) instead of a red "Audio Stopped" status, a false "Audio Recording Issues" warning, and an "Audio stopped" notification
- Added quiet hours: a daily local-time window (e.g. 22:00–06:00, overnight allowed) during which recording and detection pause, applied live without a restart and without raising audio-status alerts. Set it under Settings → Detection → Quiet Hours with half-hour dropdowns that follow your 12/24-hour display setting; while a pause is in effect the audio status badge and a pill on every page read "Paused until …", so a quiet station is never mistaken for a broken one

## [0.8.8] - 2026-08-21

- Improved audio capture to be gapless: each source now records through one persistent ffmpeg stream (restarted automatically on failure) instead of a new process per segment, eliminating the dead air between recordings that cost slower devices like the Pi Zero 2W ~25-30% of all audio. Segments are also written in a single burst, which lets short-lived queue files avoid the SD card entirely on most systems; set `BIRDNET_CAPTURE_MODE=segment` to revert to per-segment capture
- Fixed startup dying permanently when Docker is left with corrupted container records after an unclean shutdown: the service now detects and repairs them once per boot (removing the broken records with the daemon stopped) and retries, keeps retrying failed starts indefinitely instead of giving up after five attempts, and logs the underlying Docker error instead of swallowing it
- Fixed the live-stream service starting an encoder for disabled audio sources; a disabled source could keep an ffmpeg reconnect loop running against its camera 24/7

## [0.8.7] - 2026-08-16

- Added optional cleanup policies alongside the existing disk-threshold cleanup: keep only the last N days of recordings, or cap total media at N GB (both off by default), with a preview endpoint that reports exactly what a policy would delete before enabling it
- Improved dashboard summary and trends performance on large databases dramatically: the all-time summary dropped from ~10 seconds to ~26 milliseconds on a 1.1M-detection station, served from new per-day aggregate tables that build themselves in the background after upgrading
- Improved automatic storage cleanup for small devices (Pi Zero 2W class): it no longer holds an in-memory listing of every media file (~95MB on a full card) or re-scans the whole detection table when the disk is full of non-BirdNET data, and its space accounting now uses real recorded file sizes instead of a per-file average
- Improved the bird details Recordings section: "Best" and "Most Recent" now rank only clips whose files still exist, so pages fill with genuinely playable recordings instead of coming up short (or empty) when a species' top detections have aged out of storage
- Improved crash-safety of recordings: media files are now published atomically and tracked per detection, so an interruption mid-write can no longer leave partial files behind, and files orphaned by a crash are automatically repaired or cleaned up by a weekly maintenance sweep
- Changed new recordings' filenames to include a unique per-detection suffix, preventing same-second detections of one species from ever colliding on disk
- Fixed Docker build caches crossing between staging and main, which could make an unchanged staging image download new layers after a release promotion

## [0.8.6] - 2026-08-08

- Fixed detection deletion removing only one copy of a recording's media when duplicates existed under different naming eras (source-ID transition, legacy colon pattern); the surviving copy was orphaned on disk forever. Deletion now removes every variant it finds
- Fixed detection deletion responses reporting the generated filename instead of the legacy media file actually removed
- Fixed automatic storage cleanup skipping audio and spectrogram files created during the source-ID filename transition, allowing upgraded stations to reclaim those legacy recordings
- Improved native updates on Raspberry Pis by stabilizing Docker base layers between releases and removing the backend compiler toolchain from the runtime image, reducing both routine downloads and slow SD-card extraction
- Improved update download size again: bundled model files (V2.4 model, species table, eBird codes) now live in their own cached image layers instead of re-downloading with every release, shrinking a routine update's backend download from ~55MB to a few megabytes
- Changed the offline timezone lookup (used when saving a station location) to a much smaller library, trimming ~55MB from the backend image and removing the last need for a compiler during image builds
- Fixed failed update checks exposing the exact installed commit to anonymous visitors through detailed GitHub error URLs; diagnostics remain available to signed-in owners and in logs
- Fixed authentication and settings temporary files being readable by other local users while sensitive content was still being written; private files now start owner-only
- Fixed a password-change race that could leave previously issued audio links valid until the API service restarted
- Fixed password-change eviction relying on cooperative browser code for open WebSockets; revoked owner connections are now disconnected by the server
- Fixed a rare password-change race where a simultaneous first media or share link could restore the old password and revoked sessions
- Fixed two smaller Table-view issues: a slow, abandoned query (filter or page changed while it was still loading) could return late and overwrite the newer results, and deleting right after a restart could report "cannot reach the server" for a delete that actually succeeded. Late responses are now discarded, and deletes get the same generous timeout as reads
- Fixed clicking a dashboard chart cell sometimes leaving the Table view stuck on a spinner and ending in "Hmm, cannot reach the server", even though a manual refresh always loaded instantly — worst right after a service restart. Requests could strand on the boundary between the API's request greenlets and its database worker thread — in the thread pool's job handoff, and in the settings/auth locks via a gevent lost-wakeup bug (present in gevent 24.11.1 and 26.7.0) — until an unrelated request happened to arrive and shake them loose. Both paths are now strand-proof, and the Table fetch gets the dashboard's 45-second budget so genuinely slow cold queries show a longer spinner instead of a dead view
- Changed password changes to sign out every other device, so changing the password actually evicts someone who obtained a session rather than leaving their existing sign-in valid. The device you change it from stays signed in, and open live-feed or settings tabs elsewhere lose their connection immediately
- Changed password changes to also invalidate existing share links and previously issued audio links, since a session that was signed in could have created them. Re-share any link you still want to work
- Fixed an unreadable `auth.json` (a power cut mid-write could truncate it) being silently replaced with an auth-disabled config, which discarded the password, turned authentication off, and left the station open for anyone to claim with a new password. The file is now flushed to disk before being published, and a config that cannot be read is left alone instead of overwritten
- Fixed the settings file being world-readable on disk; it holds camera credentials, notification service URLs and the station's coordinates. New installs write it owner-only and updating repairs existing ones
- Fixed anonymous visitors being able to read the exact build commit and how many updates the station is behind, which the version endpoint deliberately withholds; the update indicator still works when signed out
- Fixed the live feed's stream picker showing your own source names ("Back garden") to anonymous listeners; they now see "Source 1", "Source 2"
- Fixed a stale "System update available" banner flashing on the Settings page for a second between the end of an update (or restart) and the page reload; the banner now reads "Reloading..." until the refreshed page arrives
- Improved update download size: the backend image no longer ships a duplicated file-ownership layer, cutting roughly 130MB from every update's download and ~250MB from the image's size on disk
- Fixed locally built backend images baking in a leftover `backend/data` directory (database, auth secrets, station coordinates) when one existed from running the backend outside Docker; pre-built images were never affected
- Improved the dashboard's Activity Overview on desktop: tall monitors now get a taller card showing up to 15 species instead of 10, using vertical space that previously sat blank. The card grows with the actual species count — with 10 or fewer it stays at the compact height rather than stretching a short list. Laptop-sized windows and mobile keep the compact 10-row card
- Improved the dashboard's Recent Observations on tall monitors to match: the list shows 8 entries instead of 7, and the Hourly Activity chart beside it grows to keep the two cards level
- Added an installer option to choose the web interface port (`--port 8080`) for systems where port 80 is already taken, e.g. by Pi-hole or another web server. The choice persists across updates, and `--update --port N` moves an existing installation
- Added pre-built AMD64 images: releases now publish multi-arch (ARM64 + AMD64) container images, so x86 installs pull them during install and update instead of building everything locally
- Added an update screen for visitors who open the app while a native update is running: instead of a dashboard full of failed requests, the page now explains an update is in progress, shows its current stage, and reloads itself when the system is back
- Improved the update banner to show what the update is actually doing ("Pulling the latest images from GHCR (2 of 3)", "Building images locally", …) in place of the elapsed-seconds counter, which made a normal update look like it was stalling; Home Assistant updates, which have no stages to report, show a steady "Updating via Home Assistant". On native installs the web server now stays up through the long download/build phase, so the page keeps responding where it previously showed a connection error until the update finished
- Changed the documented hardware support to Raspberry Pi 5, 4, 3, and Zero 2W, with a note on what to expect from each, since the low-memory work in recent releases made the smaller boards usable. Previously the docs asked for a Pi 4 or newer with 2GB+ RAM
- Improved the wait shown after saving settings: the banner now reads "Settings saved — restarting services to apply" instead of "Applying settings changes", and drops the elapsed-seconds counter. The save itself is instant; the wait is the service restart, and a ticking timer made a normal restart look like a slow save
- Improved the species detail page layout on desktop: the distribution chart now stretches to fill its card instead of leaving blank space beneath it
- Fixed species photos on the detail page cropping the bird out of view: the smart-crop focal point was computed for a square frame, but the detail page's image box is wider on desktop. The crop now adapts to the box's real shape and follows it across resizes
- Fixed night-time detections showing a daytime sun icon in the weather conditions card: clear, partly-cloudy, and rain-shower icons now switch to their night variants after sunset, computed from the detection's own time and the station location — past detections get the correct icon retroactively

## [0.8.5] - 2026-07-25

- Changed bird-specific wording to species, since detections aren't limited to birds: the Observation Summary now reads "Most Common Species" and "Rarest Species", and the dashboard and charts headings read "Activity Overview". The summary API fields were renamed to match (`mostCommonBird` → `mostCommonSpecies`, `rarestBird` → `rarestSpecies`, and their `ScientificName`/`Display` variants) — a breaking change for anything reading `/api/observations/summary` or `/api/dashboard` directly
- Fixed the updating/restarting banner reloading into a dead page on slow devices (e.g. Pi Zero 2W): the page could mistake the old server, still shutting down, for the restarted one and refresh too early. It now waits until the server proves it came back (new process or version identity) before reloading, allows slow-hardware updates up to 30 minutes instead of 10, and reports a failed update outright instead of waiting forever
- Fixed species detail and shared-recording pages rendering blank, or showing only part of a bird's history, for the ~160 species the model lists under two scientific names after a taxonomy genus split (e.g. Little Ringed Plover, Cattle Egret, Snowy Plover). Detections recorded under either name now merge into one record, while two different birds that merely share an English name (e.g. Black Vulture) stay separate
- Fixed the dashboard call player's rolling spectrogram scrolling a strip of blank columns in at the right edge when playback ended — the display now stops together with the audio
- Added a per-species summary table maintained alongside every detection, replacing repeated full-history scans as the source for species facts. It verifies itself at startup and rebuilds automatically if anything drifts
- Improved the heaviest species queries by serving them from the new summary table: the dashboard's recent-unique-species list drops from up to seconds on busy stations to ~1ms (this was a known cause of intermittent dashboard timeouts), the species catalog and gallery load in ~1ms instead of scanning the full detection history, and the species detail card computes about twice as fast
- Improved species detail chart loading: the per-species distribution queries now use an indexed time-range scan instead of examining every detection of the species per chart view — up to 7x faster on frequently detected species, most noticeable on low-power devices
- Added automatic weekly database health care: an integrity check that raises a loud alert at the first sign of SD-card corruption, and a rotating compacted backup (kept twice, skipped when disk space is tight) stored next to the database so detection history can be restored after corruption or an accidental deletion
- Improved repeat query performance on low-memory devices: database connections are now kept warm per worker instead of reopened for every query, so frequently used index pages stay cached in memory rather than being re-read from the SD card on every dashboard refresh
- Improved BirdNET-Pi imports on low-memory devices: duplicate checking no longer loads every existing detection into memory (hundreds of MB against a large database — an out-of-memory risk); it now checks each incoming record against the database index directly
- Improved query planning reliability: the database now maintains real table statistics (refreshed cheaply at every startup), so queries keep choosing good indexes as detection history grows instead of relying on guesswork
- Improved database write efficiency and cache use by dropping four detection indexes (~100MB, 15% of a mature database) that no query uses — two were never referenced and two are covered by existing composite indexes. Every detection insert now updates 6 index trees instead of 10, reducing SD-card wear; existing databases are migrated automatically at startup
- Improved model startup resilience: recordings remain queued during model-service outages, V2.4 meta-model and V3.1 startup failures are surfaced in Settings, and obsolete V3.0 downloads are reclaimed in either model mode
- Changed BirdNET V3 to the bundled V3.1 pruned FP16 model, cutting the model from about 541 MB to 72 MB and removing the first-use download while preserving the 11K-species label contract
- Improved BirdNET V3 location filtering by updating the bundled BirdNET+ Geomodel from v3.0.1 to v3.0.3, expanding acoustic-label coverage and validating the model, labels, tensor contract, and license as one release pair during builds and startup
- Improved geomodel failure handling by enforcing its complete probability contract and showing a persistent Settings warning when location filtering degrades, while acoustic detection continues uninterrupted

## [0.8.4] - 2026-07-12

- Added a Site URL setting (Settings → Personalization): set your station's public address and detection notifications include a link straight to that detection's page. On private stations (public access off) the link carries a 30-day single-detection share token so it works without logging in
- Improved dashboard responsiveness on busy stations: a new detection no longer throws away every cached dashboard summary. The week, 30-day, and all-time tabs — the heaviest queries on low-power devices — now stay warm and refresh on their own schedule (5 minutes / 1 hour), and a summary computation already in progress is served instead of being discarded and recomputed. Previously, stations detecting faster than every 10 seconds kept these caches permanently cold, recomputing full-table statistics on nearly every dashboard refresh
- Fixed the dashboard staying on loading spinners forever when the very first settings request failed — common on busy low-power stations where that request can time out. The dashboard now loads its data anyway (showing its normal error state if that also fails), and the settings load retries in the background so display preferences, the station name, and first-run setup still arrive
- Fixed Docker container logs growing without bound between updates — on SD-card installs they could slowly fill the card. Container logs are now capped per service, and each log line is written to the card once instead of two to three times: full INFO detail lives in the existing size-capped `data/logs/` files (and the in-app log viewer), while container logs carry warnings and errors (set `CONSOLE_LOG_LEVEL=INFO` to restore verbose container logs)
- Fixed the setup wizard reporting "Failed to save settings" when the post-setup restart merely took longer than expected — it now shows a notice that settings were saved and the restart is still in progress, matching how system updates report slow restarts
- Fixed the restart/update progress banner's elapsed-seconds counter freezing or under-reporting while a connection attempt was still pending; it now advances in five-second steps independently of connection checks
- Fixed dismissing an error banner or closing the species-filter modal while a restart was still being monitored not actually stopping the monitor — its leftover timers could bring stale banner messages back or reload the page unexpectedly
- Improved per-detection audio clip creation to run as a single ffmpeg step instead of a sox trim followed by a separate ffmpeg encode — one process launch instead of two and no intermediate WAV written to the SD card, which meaningfully lowers the per-detection cost on slow devices (a busy dawn chorus is where stations fall behind). Output clips are byte-identical to before, and sox is no longer needed or installed
- Fixed abandoned temporary recording files accumulating in the recordings folder: a recorder interrupted mid-write (for example by an out-of-memory kill) left behind a `.tmp.wav` file that was never cleaned up, so debris could build up over time. The recorder now sweeps these stale temp files from its own folder when it starts
- Fixed automatic storage cleanup straining low-memory devices on stations with long histories: it no longer loads every detection into memory (hundreds of MB on large databases) nor re-checks millions of already-cleaned recordings on every run — deletable files are now found through small indexed queries and bounded batches, resuming where the previous run left off
- Fixed the detections CSV export and the species-column sort in non-English languages loading every matching detection into memory — on stations with very large detection histories this could stall or crash the API service, especially on low-memory devices. The export now streams in small batches (constant memory at any table size), and the localized sort fetches only the page being viewed
- Improved detection spectrogram rendering to be ~4x faster and much lighter: images are composed directly with numpy + PIL instead of matplotlib, dropping matplotlib and scipy from the backend entirely (~85MB less memory in the recording process, ~190MB smaller install). Output layout was matched pixel-for-pixel against the previous renderer, so new images blend seamlessly with existing ones
- Improved backend memory use, especially on small devices (~60MB less resident across the services): the inference service reads recordings with the standard-library WAV reader instead of scipy, the location meta-model now loads only for its roughly-weekly refresh instead of staying resident, and the timezone-lookup library no longer loads at API startup — it's pulled in only when a saved location changes
- Added installer support for reclaiming unused GPU memory on headless Raspberry Pis with under 1GB of usable memory (e.g. Pi Zero 2W): `gpu_mem=16` returns ~48MB (~11% of a Zero 2W's RAM) to the system, which field testing showed takes a 512MB station from constant swap-thrash timeouts to a responsive dashboard. Applied conservatively — headless low-memory Pis only, never overriding an existing `gpu_mem` setting or a legacy camera stack — reapplied on updates (set your own `gpu_mem` value to opt out), and removed cleanly by `uninstall.sh`
- Fixed installation on Ubuntu 25.10 and newer (including 26.04 LTS), where the service crash-looped on startup and no containers came up. These releases replace sudo with `sudo-rs`, which rejects the wildcard the installer wrote into its sudoers rules, so the installer discarded the whole file and left the service unable to start PulseAudio without a password. The rule now pins the service user's ID instead of globbing it, and a rejected sudoers file reports the exact error rather than failing silently
- Fixed the Bird Activity Overview rows getting slightly taller with each larger species limit — cells are now the same height whether showing 10, 20, 30, or All species (days with fewer than 10 species still stretch to fill the minimum chart height)

## [0.8.3] - 2026-07-05

- Fixed the dashboard behind the login prompt claiming "Hmm, cannot reach the server" when public access is disabled — it now stays blank like other sign-in-gated pages (auth-gated data elsewhere says "Sign in to view this data" instead of the false connection error), and the dashboard loads right after signing in instead of waiting for the next refresh
- Fixed dashboard data updates around background tabs: switching away could leave the page quietly polling in the background, and coming back could show stale data; the dashboard now pauses cleanly while hidden and refreshes immediately on return when its data has gone stale
- Fixed the detection player's weather strip showing an empty gray cell when the visible stats didn't fill the grid — the strip now shows humidity, wind, clouds, precipitation, and pressure in a single row that always fills cleanly; on phones it compacts to a 2×2 grid, dropping the least essential pressure tile
- Changed Recent Observations to show Unique species by default, with the toggle reordered to Unique | All; a previously chosen All preference is kept
- Fixed Docker build-cache cleanup never actually reclaiming space after builds and updates — modern Docker silently ignores the age filter the scripts relied on, so stations that build locally accumulated tens of GB of stale cache over time. Cleanup now caps the cache at 5GB (override with `BUILD_CACHE_LIMIT` as an environment variable or `.env` entry), evicting the oldest entries first so recent layers stay warm for fast rebuilds
- Changed the dashboard's latest observation card (image and names) and the recent observations list's bird names to open that detection's player in place when clicked, instead of navigating to the species page; Ctrl/Cmd/middle-click still opens the detection's own page in a new tab. The card's timestamp is now plain text (it previously opened the detections table)
- Changed the detection player's scientific name to link to the species page, matching the common name above it, and added a small link icon next to the common name so the navigation is discoverable
- Fixed the detection modal staying open when clicking the species name inside it — the page behind changed while the modal lingered on top; it now closes on any in-app navigation
- Fixed the setup wizard's address search always failing ("Search failed. Please try again or enter coordinates manually.") — the 0.8.2 security policy blocked the browser's request to the OpenStreetMap geocoding service; it is now explicitly allowed
- Fixed clicks on species and page links doing nothing in browser tabs loaded before an update ("Failed to fetch dynamically imported module" in the console) — the app now recovers by reloading itself onto the intended page, and the web server tells browsers to always revalidate the app shell so a stale build doesn't linger in cache after an update

## [0.8.2] - 2026-07-02

- Added an analysis-window bar under the detection player's spectrogram showing which 3-second slice of the clip the model actually flagged (the rest is context audio around it); click a tile to jump playback there. When the same species also fired in neighboring slices of the same recording, those windows are marked too, so a clip with back-to-back calls doesn't read as one detection surrounded by silence
- Improved API responsiveness on the Pi: the auth configuration is now cached instead of re-read from disk several times per request, hot access checks skip a full settings copy, and signed media links are only minted for logged-out viewers (owners' detection payloads slim down since their session already authorizes playback)
- Added an "Allow public access" switch (Settings → Security): with authentication enabled you can keep a limited public view (dashboard, gallery, and bird pages without login) or turn it off to require sign-in for everything. When off it also overrides the per-feature public toggles, and the station name is no longer shown to logged-out visitors
- Hardened the API so enabling authentication actually keeps detection data private: the logged-out view is now enforced and bounded server-side (it previously left many endpoints open, so a script could rebuild the database even with the Table hidden), and is limited to recent activity — logged-out visitors get a capped, recent window per species and can no longer open or play older detections by guessing or walking permalink URLs (older ones need a login or a share link), and a published Table likewise shows them only the recent window. Login rate-limiting can't be bypassed via a forged forwarding header, the internal detection-broadcast endpoints now require a shared secret, and a default-deny backstop keeps any future endpoint private to logged-out visitors unless explicitly opened
- Closed the last logged-out scraping hole for media: with authentication enabled, detection audio and spectrogram files are served only via short-lived signed links that the dashboard, gallery, and bird pages mint for the clips they show — so a logged-out visitor can still play those clips, but the recordings can no longer be bulk-downloaded by guessing filenames. Signed-in owners are unaffected
- Tightened what logged-out visitors can see further: per-detection source labels (and the internal source id) are stripped from public responses, and the system info endpoints (version, storage, update check) are now part of the limited public view rather than readable behind the login wall
- Fixed recorder health (audio source names and stream error text, which can include camera URLs/credentials) being pushed to logged-out viewers over the live-feed WebSocket when the live feed is public — it now goes only to signed-in owners, matching the authenticated status endpoint
- Hardened the public version info: logged-out visitors now see only the version number, not the exact build commit and branch (which fingerprint the build for known-vulnerability matching); signed-in owners still see full details
- Improved transport hardening: the session cookie is now marked Secure automatically when the station is reached over HTTPS (e.g. behind a TLS proxy or tunnel), so it can't be replayed over a downgraded plain-HTTP hop, while plain-HTTP LAN logins keep working; the web server also sends a Content-Security-Policy header (permitting WebAssembly compilation, which the Live Feed's Safari stream decoder needs) and rate-limits the API read path (with a tighter budget on login attempts), so a scraper can't turn the bounded public view into a bulk download by request volume
- Changed the detection "Share" button to create a scoped share link: the link opens that one detection (its player, spectrogram, and clip) for someone without an account — even on a fully private station — but can't be edited to browse other detections, so sharing one sighting never exposes the rest
- Fixed the detection player stuttering in the first second of playback on Safari and iOS — the audio and the moving playhead would briefly freeze then jump. Playback now feeds the decoded audio straight through Web Audio instead of routing an `<audio>` element, which avoids a Safari startup glitch; the player declares a "playback" audio session so the iPhone ringer switch doesn't mute it, and recovers after a phone call or backgrounding
- Changed the detection player's spectrogram to reflect the high-pass filter the same way the Live Feed does — cut frequencies gently fade instead of being hidden under a heavy black overlay, so the picture matches what the filter does to the audio
- Added rich link previews for shared detection permalinks — pasting one into iMessage, Slack, Discord, etc. now unfurls into a card with the bird's photo, species, confidence, and time. On an authenticated station the card details only what a logged-out visitor could open (recent detections, or any detection via its share link); anything else unfurls as a generic branded card

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-28

- Fixed the Live Feed and Dashboard playback spectrograms scrolling at different speeds across browsers and displays — they advanced a fixed step per animation frame, so speed tracked the refresh rate (e.g. Safari vs Chrome, or 60 Hz vs 120 Hz screens) and a given call rendered wider or narrower per screen. Both now scroll at a fixed rate in real time, so audio features keep a consistent size on any display
- Added the live spectrogram and high-pass/gain filters to the Live Feed on Safari, which couldn't show them before — Safari can't tap a live stream through Web Audio the normal way, so the audio is now decoded in-browser and fed through the same graph (it falls back to plain playback if the decoder can't load)
- Improved the high-pass and gain sliders for touch — the thumb and track are larger on phones and tablets so they're easier to grab and harder to miss, while the desktop slider is unchanged
- Polished the high-pass/gain filter panels on the Live Feed and detection player — the sliders now sit vertically centered in the grey panel instead of low (the slider thumb was poking into the panel's bottom padding), and the Live Feed's live spectrogram is a bit shorter on small screens
- Tightened the Live Feed layout on phones — smaller gaps, padding, and slider thumb plus a slightly shorter spectrogram, so the first detection shows without scrolling as far; desktop spacing is unchanged

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-27

- Fixed the public detection/observation/recording API responses leaking the station's exact coordinates — latitude/longitude are now stripped at the data layer so these endpoints stay private-by-default while share permalinks keep working without login. The authenticated CSV export still includes coordinates
- Changed `/api/settings/defaults` to require authentication, since it carries the default station coordinates and is only used as an authenticated-load fallback
- Added shareable permalinks to individual recordings — a "Share" button copies a deep link that opens a dedicated player page (spectrogram, audio player, download), so you can point others at a specific detection instead of just the species
- Changed the species page's Recordings grid to use this same custom player instead of the browser's default audio bar, so playback and sharing are consistent everywhere; per-clip download moved to the detail page
- Fixed the bird detail page's Recordings grid showing dead players and placeholder spectrograms for detections whose audio had been cleaned up — such records are now skipped so the grid only shows playable clips
- Changed the shared detection player page to a single-card layout — a framed spectrogram with time axis, unified playback and high-pass/gain controls, a confidence score, and weather plus detection metadata inline, with the eBird code now linking out to that species' eBird page
- Changed the Detections table's per-row info button to open the full detection player in an in-place modal instead of a small info modal, so you keep your place in the table; ⌘/Ctrl/middle-click still opens it in a new tab
- Added the current page, filters, and sort to the Detections table's URL, so a refresh, bookmark, or Back button restores the exact view instead of snapping back to page 1
- Improved modal dismissal consistency — viewer, settings, confirmation, and workflow dialogs now close via the close button, backdrop, or Escape when safe, while saving/testing/processing states still block accidental dismissal
- Added live high-pass filter and gain controls to the Live Feed, matching the detection player — filter out low-frequency rumble (which also clears from the live spectrogram) and boost quiet audio, all non-destructively while listening
- Changed the Live Feed spectrogram to match the detection player's look — same green palette, 0–12 kHz range, and contrast — so the live and recorded views read as one instrument
- Changed the Dashboard's Latest Observation spectrogram to a fixed brightness window (matching the Live Feed) instead of auto-gaining to the loudest sound, so brightness stays steady during playback rather than fluctuating
- Fixed the Live Feed's high-pass and gain controls showing on Safari, where they had no effect — Safari doesn't route the live stream through Web Audio (the same reason the live spectrogram is unavailable there), so the controls are now hidden with a note that audio still plays
- Updated frontend dependencies (form-data, ws, js-yaml) to clear three Dependabot security advisories

## [0.7.5] - 2026-06-20

- Fixed the Dashboard's live playback spectrogram scrolling through blank columns while audio is still loading or buffering — the canvas now only advances while real audio is playing
- Added an early installer check that stops on 32-bit OSes with a clear "reflash with the 64-bit image" message — BirdNET-PiPy is arm64-only, and previously the install aborted partway through with a blank web UI
- Fixed the installer aborting when run from a directory other than the cloned repo, and restored the dev-branch "building locally" detection that a `--skip-build` shortcut had bypassed
- Added an optional "Normalize Recording" toggle (Settings → Personalization) that loudness-normalizes saved detection clips so faint or distant birds are easier to hear. It runs after BirdNET analysis so detection is unaffected, applies to new recordings only, and is off by default
- Added an "Always Include Species" list (Settings → Species Filter) that reports the listed species even when the location filter rates them unlikely for your coordinates
- Fixed long photographer names wrapping the "Photo by …" image attribution onto a second line — the name now truncates with an ellipsis in gallery cards, bird detail pages, and the image picker
- Fixed the Live Feed giving up with "Could not start audio playback" when an RTSP audio source drops mid-stream (some cameras periodically end their audio track) — the player now retries with backoff and self-heals instead of forcing a manual restart. Also fixed the stream "Test" button timing out before the backend probe could answer, and showing a generic "Test request failed" instead of a timeout-specific message
- Changed spectrograms to use an absolute full-scale dBFS reference instead of per-clip auto-gain, so loudness is comparable across recordings — quiet detections render dim and loud ones bright, instead of every clip being peak-normalized to its own maximum

## [0.7.4] - 2026-05-31

- Changed Bird Gallery tab switches to show a loading spinner while an uncached tab's query runs, instead of leaving the previous tab's cards on screen until it resolves. Revisiting a cached tab is still instant
- Added the "scroll to top" button to the Bird Gallery (previously only on the Detections table); the bottom-right status indicators now yield the corner so they no longer overlap it
- Fixed Bird Gallery thumbnails intermittently not appearing — the gallery now serves Wikimedia's smaller thumbnail and loads card images lazily as they near the viewport, instead of fanning out a lookup for all ~200 species when the Species Catalog opens
- Fixed saved "customize image" choices still loading the full-resolution original in the gallery — a choice now stores and serves a thumbnail (re-save older choices to shrink them)
- Hardened the Wikimedia image proxy against rate limiting — a 429 surfaces the upstream `Retry-After` instead of a 500, concurrent misses for the same species share one fetch, and gallery lookups skip Wikimedia for species that already have a custom image
- Added a contact URL to the Wikimedia API `User-Agent` per Wikimedia's policy, keeping the app in the 200 req/min identified tier rather than the 10 req/min "unidentified" tier
- Fixed the "Most Activity Time" on a bird's detail page ignoring the "Use 24-hour Clock" preference and always showing 24-hour time
- Fixed RTSP audio sources (e.g. some IP cameras) timing out when added or recorded even though the stream plays in VLC — ffmpeg now prefers TCP with UDP fallback instead of forcing TCP, with longer connection-test timeouts for slow handshakes

## [0.7.3] - 2026-05-27

- Fixed RTSP audio recordings being choppy from well-behaved producers such as mediamtx restreaming a local capture — an `aresample` ffmpeg filter (added earlier to handle IP cameras with non-monotonic timestamps) was injecting silence and warping samples in response to ordinary network jitter, and has been removed from the recorder and live stream

## [0.7.2] - 2026-05-23

- Improved dashboard resilience on slow devices such as the Raspberry Pi Zero, where API requests routinely exceed the frontend's timeout — a failed `/settings` request no longer hides the whole dashboard, a failed refresh keeps the last-good data on screen, request timeouts are sized per endpoint, and navigation no longer blocks on an `/auth/status` roundtrip
- Fixed the metric/imperial unit and time-format toggles in Settings silently failing to apply when the settings store hadn't loaded — they now propagate their change directly
- Consolidated frontend settings handling — `/settings` is now fetched once into a shared store that feeds the unit and time-format composables, replacing several independent fetch sites
- Fixed Bird Gallery cards intermittently falling back to the placeholder after the first ~8-9 species — the image worker pool added in 0.7.1 fired too many concurrent Wikimedia hits and tripped the burst throttle, so image loads are now serialized
- Fixed the Dashboard's Observation Summary card growing taller than the adjacent Latest Observation card at narrow widths when long bird names wrapped — names now truncate to a single line (full name on hover, click still opens the species page)
- Fixed the Distribution chart on bird detail pages occasionally rendering blank when the window was resized quickly — competing resize handlers were racing and latching a 0-width canvas, and now defer to Chart.js's built-in resize handling

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-21

- Sped up Bird Gallery tab loading — the Species Catalog drops its per-species API fan-out, sightings are computed in one query instead of three table scans, results are cached, and card images load in the background without blocking the tab switch
- Changed Dashboard Summary to load only the visible Today tab up front and lazy-load 7-Day, 30-Day, and All Time on selection, keeping the initial payload small
- Fixed dashboard navigation freezing after the 0.7.0 gunicorn+gevent migration — the dashboard's sequential SQLite queries blocked the single event loop, stalling concurrent requests; DB work now runs on a dedicated thread executor with short-TTL caching
- Fixed dashboard summary stats (Most Common, Rarest, Most Active Hour) showing inconsistent species names across periods after a V2→V3 upgrade — each species now resolves to one canonical name, with alphabetical tie-breaks so low-activity picks no longer flap
- Fixed the Charts page flashing empty-state messages during the initial fetch, a stale chart leaking on a failed refetch, and a mount race that left the trends canvas blank — loading, error, and empty are now distinct states
- Fixed the bird detail page flashing "No recordings available" and a blank distribution chart during the initial fetch — each now shows a spinner until its data loads, and a slow image lookup no longer stalls the others
- Fixed Hourly Activity heatmap cells not deep-linking into the Table on the Charts page

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-18

- Added an "Audio Status" notification trigger (Settings → Notifications): when an Apprise URL is configured and the toggle is on, audio-pipeline degradation and recovery are pushed as notifications — one alert on degrade/stop (with the affected source and last ffmpeg error), an escalation if it worsens to fully stopped, and one recovery alert. Flapping streams are debounced (10-min cooldown) and startup never alerts. Off by default; the Notifications section subtitle is broadened to "Detection and system status alerts"
- Made the Hourly Activity heatmap a drill-down into the Table: clicking an hour label filters the Table to that day/hour, clicking a cell also filters by species. Adds a desktop "Hour" dropdown and an `hour` (0–23) param on `/api/detections`. Clearing filters now also strips the `date`/`hour`/`species` URL params, so a shared "cleared" view stays cleared
- Upgraded the frontend build to Vite 7 and `@vitejs/plugin-vue` 6, dropping the no-longer-needed `esbuild >=0.25.0` override
- Replaced the Werkzeug dev server with gunicorn + a single gevent WebSocket worker for the API container, dropping the `allow_unsafe_werkzeug` override. The single worker is intentional: live detections fan out via in-process `socketio.emit` (no Redis queue), so extra workers would silently drop Live Feed broadcasts — heavy maintenance jobs now cooperatively yield to keep it responsive. Added an unauthenticated `/api/health` route with a docker-compose healthcheck, and raised the nginx `/socket.io/` proxy timeout to 3600s so idle Live Feed sockets aren't reaped. Local `python -m core.api` still uses the threading dev server

## [0.6.10] - 2026-05-12

- Fixed Hourly Activity bar chart and heatmap tooltips still showing raw 24-hour labels regardless of the time-format toggle — they now run through the same `formatHourLabel` helper the x-axes already use, so 12-hour users see "2 PM" and 24-hour users see "14:00" consistently between axis and hover (follow-up on #49)

## [0.6.9] - 2026-05-12

- Extended the time-format preference to the Charts and Table date pickers — 12-hour users still see MM/DD/YYYY, 24-hour users now see ISO YYYY-MM-DD instead of the hardcoded US layout. The Table's From/To row also stretches edge-to-edge on mobile so the To picker's right edge lines up with the Species input below instead of clumping left (follow-up on #49)
- Added a "Use 24-hour Clock" toggle in Settings → Personalization that drives every time-of-day display across the app — Recent Detections list, Latest Observation timestamp, Table, Most Active Hour summary, and the Hourly Activity bar chart and heatmap x-axes. Defaults to the browser's locale on first run; the setting is only persisted once the user explicitly flips it, so existing installs aren't migrated and the toggle reflects what the OS already shows. Fixes #49, where the Hourly Activity bar chart hardcoded 12-hour AM/PM regardless of OS setting while sibling charts and lists deferred to the browser locale — producing a mix of 12h and 24h labels on the same Dashboard. Also fixes an `Intl.DateTimeFormat` quirk where `hour12: false` on `en-US` rendered midnight as "24:30" instead of "00:30" (now uses explicit `hourCycle: 'h23'`)
- Fixed Apprise notifications ignoring the Bird Name Language setting — title and body always rendered the English string straight off the model output; they now follow the user's chosen language via the same scientific-name lookup the web UI uses (#47)
- Fixed inconsistent Bird Name Language rendering across the web UI and duplicate-species rows on the Dashboard. ~17% of V2 species (e.g. "Eurasian Blackbird" for Turdus merula, vs the species table's canonical "Common Blackbird") missed the English-keyed translation and rendered in English on the Activity Overview, Charts, and Heatmap; the same species emitted under different English names by V2 vs V3 also appeared as two rows after a model switch — one translated, one not. Bird-name routes now resolve any known English variant (canonical, label_en, label_en_uk) to a stable scientific name at the API boundary, aggregations group by that key, and `/api/bird/<any-english-variant>` serves the combined V2+V3 history (#48)
- Added a WebSocket handshake regression test that exercises the real Flask-SocketIO test client instead of mocking `socketio` — would have caught the 0.6.8 Live Feed outage where Flask-SocketIO 5.5.1 crashed on Flask 3.1.3's read-only `RequestContext.session` (b6b0f26)
- Made species names on the Bird Activity Overview's Total Detections bar chart clickable — y-axis labels now link to each species's detail page on both the Dashboard and Charts views, and middle-click / "open in new tab" / keyboard focus all work as on any other text link. Implemented as an HTML overlay over the Chart.js canvas (canvas-rendered text can't be hyperlinks) with the overlay font matched to Chart.js's tick font so the labels don't render wider than they used to

## [0.6.8] - 2026-05-08

- Added a "customize image" modal on bird detail pages — pick a different Wikimedia thumbnail per species; the choice persists across redeploys as a sidecar and the gallery is live-patched on apply without a reload. Wikimedia rate-limits (429) now surface as a friendly retry-later message
- Added click-to-pause on the live spectrogram canvas — clicking pauses playback (preserving position); a suspended AudioContext is also resumed on play, so backgrounded tabs no longer render silent visuals
- Refined the Latest Observation live spectrogram to match the saved PNG — uses matplotlib's actual `Greens_r` ramp and per-playback rolling-peak dBFS normalization, with a midtone gamma lift and light analyser smoothing for a soft noise floor
- Reduced backend memory usage by ~100 MB across the three Python processes — multi-language species table now uses columnar arrays with lazy per-language loading (active per-process footprint drops from ~21 MB to ~4 MB), shared strings are interned, and the inference server no longer reads the multi-language CSV
- Fixed Live Feed breaking behind HTTPS-terminating reverse proxies and Cloudflare tunnels — inner nginx was overwriting `X-Forwarded-Proto` with `http`, causing Engine.IO to reject the browser's `https://` origin on `/socket.io/` POSTs; the header is now passed through verbatim
- Fixed the dashboard's Latest Observation spectrogram axis starting above 0 Hz — live canvas and saved PNG now align at 0 Hz
- Bumped Flask-SocketIO to 5.6.1 for Flask 3.1.3 compatibility
- Bumped frontend dependencies to clear 25 Dependabot alerts

## [0.6.7] - 2026-05-03

- Fixed audio recordings getting stuck in an infinite reprocess loop when post-analysis steps (audio extraction, spectrogram generation, BirdWeather upload, etc.) raised — the same WAV would be re-collected on the next scan and retried forever, spamming logs with duplicate "Bird detected" lines and amplifying the FD pressure that caused the failure. The processing loop now isolates per-file and per-detection failures and always removes the WAV in a `finally` block (#46)
- Added file descriptor exhaustion diagnostics — when an EMFILE/ENFILE error is detected anywhere in the recording or processing pipeline, the next log line dumps the FD limit, current FD count, a sample of open FDs with their `/proc/self/fd` targets, and active child PIDs (catches zombie ffmpeg/sox processes holding pipes via leaked refs). Rate-limited per stage. Errno detection walks `__cause__`/`__context__`/`args` plus urllib3-style `.reason`, so EMFILE buried inside a `requests.ConnectionError(MaxRetryError(...))` chain is caught
- Added recency-based recording protection — the latest N recordings per species are now retained alongside the existing top-N-by-confidence rule via union, so frequent recent activity isn't lost when its confidences fall below the top-N cut
- Hid the Bird Activity Overview reverse toggle on days with no detections, since reversing an empty list is a no-op
- Replaced the camera icon on bird detail pages with an upload arrow that animates open on hover to reveal "Upload custom image"
- Redesigned the dashboard's Latest Observation card — bird image and text stack now sit side-by-side instead of vertically; the scientific name is shown again as a link to the bird's detail page, and the timestamp and confidence link to the Table view; long species names wrap to a second line instead of being clipped mid-word; a thin vertical divider separates the bird identity area from the spectrogram, which sits visually centered between the divider and the card edge
- Polished the Latest Observation live spectrogram rendering — palette now matches the static spectrogram's `Greens_r` style (light background, dark green peaks), the canvas renders at 2× internal resolution for sharper downsampled output, and each new column is drawn as a horizontal gradient from the previous frame's intensities so time-axis transitions are continuous rather than stepped

## [0.6.6] - 2026-04-19

- Added a model picker step to the setup wizard and a one-time welcome animation after setup completes
- Fixed setup wizard silently reopening on existing installs and overwriting the chosen model and species filter threshold
- Added a Home Assistant add-on pointer in the README (alexbelgium's hassio-addons repo)

## [0.6.5] - 2026-04-18

- Fixed Pi OS Lite boot failing when a stale PulseAudio socket was left behind after the daemon died — the service now probes the existing socket with `pactl info` and resets stale runtime files before starting system-wide PulseAudio, rather than booting containers that later crash in ffmpeg with "No such process" (#42)

## [0.6.4] - 2026-04-17

- Added in-app update support for the Home Assistant addon — the Settings update card now checks the addon repo for new versions and triggers Supervisor to install them, replacing the "go to the Add-on Store" instruction
- Replaced the brittle "interpret dispatch errors" approach to detecting HA update completion with a poll of `/system/version` every 10 seconds; the page auto-reloads once the new addon container reports its version, with a 10-minute fallback message. Real backend errors (slug lookup, entity not ready) are surfaced immediately instead of waiting out the timeout
- Cleaned up Settings in HA mode: dropped the redundant "HA mode" badge and addon-repo link, kept the source-repo and addon-repo links side-by-side

## [0.6.3] - 2026-04-13

- Fixed silent regression where the default bird placeholder image was broken on individual bird detail pages (`/bird/:name`) in standard (non-HA) deployments — path resolution dropped the route segment, producing 404s that nginx's `error_page` masked by returning `index.html` as image bytes
- Fixed login error messages flashing and disappearing — the global 401 interceptor was racing with the auth endpoint's own error handling and clearing `error.value` before the user could read it
- Fixed `<a href="#system-updates">` in Settings that would have navigated away from the page under the new `<base href>` — replaced with a button and imperative scroll
- Unified deployment base-path handling via a single `<base href>` contract — the frontend declares `BASE` once from `index.html`, and axios/socket.io/router all derive from it; removes five parallel URL-shape mechanisms that had produced double-prefix bugs under HA ingress
- Set Vite `base: './'` so built `<script>`/`<link>` tags resolve via `<base href>`, enabling the HA addon to use a single nginx rewrite (down from seven `sub_filter` rules)
- Migrated internal auth calls from `fetch` to the central axios client — server error messages now surface properly instead of being mapped to generic "Connection error"
- Backend `/api/stream/config` now returns relative stream URLs (no leading slash); the frontend no longer strips the slash client-side

## [0.6.2] - 2026-04-10

- Fixed storage cleanup silently skipping multi-source detection files — cleanup query was missing the `extra` column needed to reconstruct filenames with source suffixes, so those files were never deleted
- Fixed storage cleanup reporting "candidates exhausted" instead of "target reached" when the final deletion crossed the threshold
- Optimized storage cleanup to fetch cleanup candidates once instead of twice
- Redesigned audio source selection UX — pills now open the edit modal on click instead of toggling state, preventing accidental source deactivation; enable/disable toggle moved inside the modal; opacity distinguishes active vs inactive sources
- Auto-test RTSP streams on save/add with inline progress spinner, skipping test when URL unchanged (label-only edits save instantly); same pattern applied to SetupWizard
- Restored keyboard accessibility for source and notification pills
- Reduced backend memory usage by lazy-loading spectrogram dependencies (matplotlib, scipy, Pillow) and shrinking location filter caches
- Added retry logic (3 attempts with backoff) to GHCR image pull before falling back to local build
- Fixed SetupWizard requiring a second click after "Finish anyway" when adding an RTSP source
- Fixed orphaned background monitor surviving shutdown and restarting containers after stop
- Fixed `set -e` dead branches swallowing container start/restart error messages
- Fixed word-splitting regression in install script argument passing (`--branch`, `--no-reboot`)
- Fixed GHCR pull silently succeeding with stale images when compose config returns empty — now falls back to local build
- Fixed special characters in git metadata producing invalid version.json
- Derived GHCR pull image list from compose config instead of hardcoded services
- Changed GHCR image pulls to sequential to avoid network saturation on Raspberry Pi
- Preserved Docker build cache for fallback local builds instead of pruning all layers
- Added Docker space reclamation before update fetch to prevent disk-full failures
- Fixed all shellcheck warnings across install scripts
- Fixed nginx proxy headers using `$host` instead of `$http_host`, dropping the port from upstream requests and breaking audio status indicator
- Fixed Live Feed stream URL producing double-prefixed requests under HA ingress — made stream URLs relative so they resolve via `<base href>` instead of requiring a dedicated sub_filter rule
- Fixed Live Feed showing empty pills for unlabeled RTSP streams — falls back to source ID when label is missing or empty

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-05

- Enabled multi-language bird name support for BirdNET V3.0 — filled English fallbacks for 5,235 new species in the unified species table and removed the disabled language selector restriction
- Removed 26 unused per-language V2.4 label files — all localization now goes through the unified species table
- Added auto-cleanup trigger percentage display in Settings storage card
- Hot-apply location changes (latitude, longitude, timezone) without requiring a service restart
- Decoupled timezone from TZ environment variable — reads config directly with thread-safe caching
- Fixed settings save status message overlapping the page heading on mobile
- Fixed restart progress timer showing inaccurate elapsed time — was ignoring initial delay and only updating every 20 seconds
- Fixed swap setup in install.sh for low-memory systems using GHCR pulls
- Fixed login modal appearing for unauthenticated guests on the dashboard when live feed public access was disabled — recorder health check was piggybacking on a live-feed-gated endpoint
- Decoupled recorder health from live feed into a dedicated auth-protected endpoint (`/api/recorder/status`), preventing source labels and error details from leaking to anonymous users
- Added recorder health check after login so the navbar indicator appears without a page reload

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-02

- Added multi-source audio recording — record from multiple microphones and RTSP streams simultaneously (#22)
- Added 2-step SetupWizard replacing LocationSetupModal — guides through location and audio source configuration on first use
- Added pre-built Docker image support — install pulls ARM64 images from GHCR on release branches for faster setup, falls back to local build for non-ARM64 platforms, non-standard UIDs, or non-release branches
- Added GitHub Actions CI workflow for building and pushing Docker images to GHCR
- Added edit support for notification services with pill-based URL management
- Added global recorder health warning pill — amber FAB appears on all pages (except Settings) when audio sources are degraded or stopped, with 24-hour dismiss and priority over the update indicator
- Added auto-expanded error details on Settings page when audio sources have issues
- Added 200 per-page option and scroll-to-top button in Table view
- Added location filter probability logging for top detections
- Added CLI script to regenerate buggy spectrograms
- Changed detection filenames to use source label instead of source ID
- Improved notification URL parsing: round-trip verification falls back to custom editor when parsers lose query params, and duplicate URLs are deduplicated on save
- Improved location context: replaced mutable `last_probabilities` with immutable `LocationContext`, moved probability logging to caller
- Centralized recorder state strings as shared constants
- Refactored LiveFeed stream state derivation to use computed properties
- Fixed spectrogram generation producing cropped images (restored `bbox_inches='tight'`)
- Fixed several audio sources migration issues: missing default Local Mic on fresh installs, microphone not preserved during migration, migration skipped when defaults already set the sources key, and migrated RTSP sources getting generic labels
- Fixed per-source audio error details lost in multi-stream setup
- Fixed service restart triggered when only audio source label changes
- Fixed filename collisions when different source labels sanitize to identical strings
- Fixed recorder health broadcast failing on first attempt, causing 60s startup delay
- Fixed health cache not refreshed after restart; kept Icecast alive with no active sources
- Fixed NaN values in model logs and improved system logs modal UX
- Fixed inconsistent percentage rounding in location probability logs
- Improved chunk-level logging: raw model top-3 now includes location filter probabilities for easier debugging
- Optimized model post-processing with NumPy partial sort and masking instead of full Python sort over all species
- Fixed zero-confidence species leaking into candidates when cutoff is 0.0
- Fixed security vulnerability in happy-dom (GHSA-6q6h-j7hj-3r64)
- Fixed `set_env_var` creating duplicate keys when the target key is the only line in the env file
- Fixed `.env` overwrite during GHCR pull — now preserves existing settings like `ICECAST_PASSWORD`
- Fixed `BIRDNET_CHANNEL` not sanitized on non-release branches, breaking docker compose builds
- Fixed GHCR pull check never matched due to JSON whitespace in image inspect
- Fixed parallel build race caused by duplicate build directives

## [0.5.8] - 2026-03-25

- Added location-based species filtering (geomodel) for BirdNET V3.0 — bundled geomodel filters detections by geographic probability with thread-safe caching
- Added "new species" notification trigger — alerts when a species is detected that has never been seen before
- Added unified species lookup table merging V2.4 labels (27 languages), V3.0 taxonomy, and eBird codes — enables localized bird names for V3.0 (~6K overlapping species)
- Added unique species toggle (All/Unique) to Dashboard recent observations — both lists fetched in a single API call for instant switching
- Added recorder health status to Settings — real-time recording state surfaced via WebSocket
- Added stream URL testing with card-style audio source selector and edit modal
- Added configurable species filter threshold in Settings UI
- Added system logs viewer with per-service file logging, accessible via modal in Settings
- Added restart services button in Settings Management section

- Merged Location and Audio Source into a single Settings card
- Combined detection sliders into responsive 3-column grid
- Converted Management section to collapsible, repositioned above Data

- Improved spectrogram generation performance — skip PNG encode/decode by passing raw NumPy arrays directly
- Improved recorder health UX: cleaner errors, clipboard copy, restart state feedback
- Improved log polling efficiency with AbortController and fixed formatter duplication
- Fixed V3.0 geomodel default threshold (0.15) being silently overridden by the V2.4 default (0.03) on fresh or upgraded installs
- Fixed subprocess pipe leaks and raised FD limit to prevent "too many open files" (#35)
- Fixed location change not re-applying timezone until manual restart — now triggers full service restart
- Fixed Icecast UTC timestamps not converted to local time, causing incorrect sorting
- Fixed consistent row height in Bird Activity Overview when species limit exceeds 10
- Fixed unique species query returning too few results when one species dominates recent detections — falls back to unbounded query when pre-fetch window is insufficient
- Fixed user toggle selections (activity overview, recent observations) resetting during in-flight dashboard fetches
- Fixed input validation and thread safety in model service: guard sensitivity ≤ 0, validate inference payloads, type-check settings before merge, add thread locks to shared caches
- Fixed RTSP label-only edits not tracked as unsaved changes, causing silent data loss
- Fixed recorder health status broadcasting stale pre-restart value after automatic recovery

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-07

- Added localized bird name support — display common names in 26 languages using BirdNET model labels, configurable in Settings
- Added granular per-feature access control — Charts, Table, and Live Feed can each be set public or private independently
- Added configurable station name for multi-system identification
- Added login button in header when authentication is enabled but user is not logged in
- Fixed RTSP stream handling: skip video streams, regenerate audio timestamps, and discard corrupt packets to prevent non-monotonic DTS errors
- Fixed Wikimedia image search returning non-bird images (eggs, skeletons) by excluding irrelevant terms
- Fixed bird name language setting not taking effect until service restart (stale lru_cache)
- Fixed language selector available for BirdNET v3 which has no localized labels — now disabled with explanation

- Changed Settings page layout: reorganized into logical collapsible sections with extracted ToggleSwitch component
- Changed auth settings UI: replaced blockquote-style border with subtle background panel, added inline disclosure for per-feature access toggles, moved Change Password outside panel
- Changed login modal to stay on the current page instead of redirecting to Dashboard
- Improved LiveFeed error messages with specific diagnostics (stream unavailable vs server down vs decode error) and consistent console logging

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-04

- Added Home Assistant add-on lifecycle support with restart resilience
- Added HA addon repository link on Settings page in HA mode
- Added source commit display in HA mode, hidden manual update check
- Fixed HA lifecycle provider detection fallback
- Fixed HA ingress stream config and default bird placeholder URLs

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-02

- Added notification system via Apprise with guided service picker, built-in test, and immediate autosave
- Added notification triggers: every detection (with per-species cooldown), first of day, and rare species
- Added hot-apply settings — most settings take effect immediately without a service restart, with runtime cache and change classification
- Added species limit selector (10/20/30/All) to Bird Activity Overview heatmap, defaulting to top 10
- Added selective Docker rebuild during updates — only rebuilds images whose inputs changed; added `--services` and `--version-only` flags to `build.sh`
- Changed Bird Activity Overview to show all species with dynamic chart height and smooth animated transitions
- Changed recordings sort dropdown to pill-shaped toggle
- Changed version display format to version(commit hash)
- Fixed multiple notification issues: API returning 500 for malformed payloads, URL masking crash, Home Assistant defaulting to HTTPS, MQTT silently disabled due to missing dependency, placeholders using unresolvable `.local` hostnames, and generic test error messages

- Fixed species filter modal not closing after successful hot-save
- Fixed inference shape mismatch crash by skipping stale audio files
- Fixed GitHub repository link to use remote URL from version info
- Removed incorrect `docker logs` commands from deployment README

## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-19

- Added consolidated Dashboard API into a single `/api/dashboard` endpoint, reducing 5–6 concurrent requests to 1
- Added tab visibility handling — polling pauses when tab is hidden and resumes on focus
- Added keep-alive caching for Dashboard and Gallery — navigating between pages restores state instantly without a full reload
- Added 3-state loading pattern on Dashboard to prevent false empty states before first fetch
- Added fetch race guard to prevent stale responses from overlapping requests overwriting newer data
